  We live in a day, where strangers aren’t nearly the threat that they were. Stranger danger rules taught to us as children, are disregarded as we get into their cars, and stay in their houses. Technology has provided safety allowing us to give trust to strangers… but not entirely. There are still many situations you want to avoid, and when selling things online, there are some basic guidelines to follow to stay safe, and to avoid scams.
</p>

<h3>
  Set up a Google Voice number
</h3>
<p>
  Did you know that you can look people up on Facebook from their phone number? Yeah, we know, super creepy. After hearing this, we really want to keep phone numbers limited to friends and people we trust. But what about selling online? KSL, Craig’s List and other online marketplaces require a phone number in order to use the platform. 
</p>
<p>
  Instead of using your real phone number, set up a (free) google voice number. You can install the google voice app on your phone, and it send texts and ring directly to your phone. How cool is this? No more giving out your real number to any stranger online. 
</p>
<p>
  Platforms that use internal chat applications such as Facebook Marketplace or PoshMark don’t have this issue. The handle the conversation, and you can easily block someone from contacting you again. 
</p>
<h3>
  Safe Exchange Points
</h3>
<p>
  Counties all over the country have began putting in Safe Exchange Points specifically for online transactions. A Safe Exchange Point is a designated area that is under 24-hr surveillance, if anything goes wrong, it is recorded, and help is nearby. These points are in public areas, and are often near a police station, or government building. Cities understand that selling items online to strangers is totally normal. They are encouraging these transactions, while enforcing your safety. All parties who meet at a Safe Exchange Point will be safe. Next time you have a buyer who makes you a little uneasy, but you want to continue the transaction, suggest meeting at a Safe Exchange Point!
</p>
<h3>
  Create a receipt
</h3>
<p>
  If there is any questions about the transaction, it is best to leave a trail. Paper, or electronic, doesn’t matter. Request payment through Venmo, PayPal, or whatever app is cool these days, to accept the payment. Write a receipt for the transaction, and keep a copy for your self. Get that receipt signed to be extra safe. Whatever you need to do to leave a paper trail to what you just sold (this is also a useful trick for buying and item), that the transaction was complete, and the item was accepted in the condition.
</p>
<h3>
  Check Reviews
</h3>
<p>
  KSL and Craigslist don’t offer reviews, but many other platforms do. Check for reviews of buyers before selling an item. If they have high reviews, then they are probably a safe person to sell to. If there are very poor reviews, well, you might consider choosing a different buyer. We go by a 3 star, 3 review requirement. If someone has an average of 3 stars, and at least 3 reviews, they are probably safe to sell items to. (PSA: Facebook Marketplace is removing Buyer Ratings soon!)
</p>
<h3>
  Don’t ship items
</h3>
<p>
  Unless you are selling on Poshmark, Mercari, or a platform that supports shipping, you should never ship your items. Even if someone asks you to ship an item, and insists by paying for the shipping costs. Almost all frauds and scams we have experienced have happened when shipping an item. Seriously. If you ship an item, you cannot guarantee that it arrived safely. You cannot guarantee the receipt of your money. It is hard to report fraud to a platform for a refund, if you ship the item. If someone on KSL, Craiglist, or Facebook Marketplace ask you to ship something, either take it to a selling platform that backs shipping, or just say no.
</p>
<p>
  Selling can be completely safe. There are easy tips and tricks to avoid dangerous encounters with strangers when selling, and to avoid being scammed. The biggest rule though, is use your gut. Seriously. If something feels uncertain, than pick a different buyer. Simple as that!

        Do you remember when Uber had just barely reached your town? Was it as exciting as it was in Salt Lake City? Many of my friends eventually became drivers (this was before the 2016 car age limit), thinking they would make some cash working when they wanted, and it would be so easy. I mean all you had to do was drive, right?.

      As an Uber driver, you can “work when you want”. However, it turns out to make any significant amount of money you actually need to be driving during peak hours. Say goodbye to your evenings, weekends, and social life.
      I never fell into this mindset. I was a-okay working my 9–5 job, 5 days a week. The convenience of working when you want while still making money didn’t seem like a reality when entering this “gig” economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I heard about ListValet, I reevaluated my gig economy views. ListValet is a platform where owners who have unwanted items find freelance or “gig” sellers to sell these items on KSL, Facebook Marketplace, Craiglist, etc. I was already selling my clothes on Poshmark, and occasionally (rarely, I promise) I would grab an item from my parent’s house and sell it online to make a quick extra few dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
        I reasoned with myself that, I am already selling items online. Why not sell someone else’s items while I’m at it? I might be able to make a few extra dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
        I signed up to be a seller on ListValet. The process was pretty easy. You just follow the steps on the website, confirm your email, create a password — you know the drill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I created an account, I browsed the marketplace of items owners want to have sold for them. I found a king-sized alt duvet blanket and a pair of military boots. Both postings were in pretty good condition. It was apparent why the owners wouldn’t be able to sell either the duvet or boots on their own. The pictures of the items they posted were blurry and probably taken on an iPhone 3. But that didn’t matter, they were now paying me to take care of that.
    </p>
    <p>
        I asked to sell the items and then picked up both items from the two homes after work the next day. This was probably the hardest part of the whole ListValet process, no introvert wants to socialize!
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step was easy, I took better images of the two items. Next, I spent a good 20 minutes researching what a fair price would be for these items. I added a few dollars to the “fair” price for good measure and posted them both on Facebook Marketplace, and KSL.
    </p>
    <p>
        I got a message about the brand-new military boots later that day, which I didn’t respond to until that evening. I was determined to only work on my time. The buyer was interested, so I gave him the address to my apartment building. I also wasn’t going to go out of my way to sell anything as a ListValet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The duvet was a little trickier. At first, the blanket was getting quite a bit of interest on Facebook Marketplace and KSL. I was getting many messages, but no one would commit to buying the blanket. A few minutes of digging, and I discovered why. A nearby store had posted a local ad selling a brand new king size duvet cover for half the price I was asking. Duh, I would probably buy the brand new one from the store too!
    </p>
    <p>
        I sent a screenshot of this competing ad to the real owner. She gave me the go-ahead to compete with this price. Just like that, the duvet was sold the next day. Problem solved and money made!
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, I earned a little under $20 in commission selling these two items on ListValet. I estimate that I actually “worked” maybe an hour. Maybe. The best part about this job was that I responded to messages on my own time. I posted images and captions on my own time. I met up with buyers on my own time. I never had to go out of my way. I worked this gig on my own time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine if I was selling more than just two items, and had a bit more experience, I could easily be making $30+ an hour with this gig.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next on my list of things to sell from ListValet: A prom dress, Xbox 1, and laptop. This commission will be much more significant. Wish me luck!

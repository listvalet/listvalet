        Why We Built ListValet
    </h2>
    <p>
        Selling platforms have spent billions of dollars to make selling easier. Yet, there still remains a disconnect between people with stuff and the selling platforms. We call this disconnect: the gap. Evidence of this gap can be seen in our garages, basements, closets, and storage units. In fact, an average home in the U.S. has $3,100 of unused items. That’s $391 billion dollars’ worth of items collecting dust, depreciating in value, and turning into waste.  <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHRDdPedvgd2w/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1583366400&v=beta&t=DM6xnMJFPbrDcZMhT-zwFP2irJQepUFJiLxyYkHd4qA">

      This gap within the resale market is caused by a person’s reluctance to sell an item for one reason, or possibly many. Here are a few:
      <ol>
        <li>Too busy</li>
        <li>Value of time > value of item</li>
        <li>Laziness</li>
        <li>Scams & Fraud</li>
        <li>Endless calls, texts, messages & spam. </li>
        <li>Meetups with strangers</li>
        <li>Not proficient at selling</li>
      </ol>
      So how do you cure one’s laziness? Or make up for a person’s lack of time? Or prevent scams or potentially dangerous meetups with strangers? It’s simple – hand over the task of selling to someone else. And that’s ListValet!

        Why We Built ListValet
    </h2>
    <p>
        Selling platforms have spent billions of dollars to make selling easier yet there still remains a disconnect between people with items and the selling platforms. We call this disconnect the gap and evidence of this gap can be seen in our garages, basements, closets, bedrooms, offices, spare rooms, and storage units. There are currently 128.58 million households in the United States and each household has an average of 50 unused items valuing $3,100. That’s 6.42 million items valued at $398 billion just sitting around in the average home taking up space, collecting dust, depreciating in value, and turning into waste.

        This gap within the resale market is caused by a person’s reluctance to sell an item for one reason or another. Here are a few examples:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>They're too busy and don't have the time to move these unused items</li>
      <li>Their time is more important to them than selling the item</li>
      <li>Their laziness and procrastination takes over</li>
      <li>The fear of scams & fraud keeps them from trying</li>
      <li>Dealing with endless calls, texts, messages, & spam</li>
      <li>Don't have the desire to meet with strangers</li>
      <li>Not proficient enough at selling</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So how do you cure one’s laziness? Or make up for a person’s lack of time? Or prevent scams or potentially dangerous meetups with strangers? It’s simple – hand over the task of selling to someone else. And that’s what ListValet is all about!

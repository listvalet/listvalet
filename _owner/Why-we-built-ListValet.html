        Why We Built ListValet
    </h2>
    <p>
        Selling platforms have spent billions of dollars to make selling easier yet there still remains a disconnect between people with items and the selling platforms. We call this disconnect the gap and evidence of this gap can be seen in our garages, basements, closets, bedrooms, offices, spare rooms, and storage units. There are currently 128.58 million households in the United States and each household has an average of 50 unused items valuing $3,100. That’s 6.42 million items in not being used valuing at $398 billion dollars worth of items collecting dust, depreciating in value, and turning into waste.

      This gap within the resale market is caused by a person’s reluctance to sell an item for one reason, or possibly many. Here are a few:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Too busy</li>
    <li>Value of time > value of item</li>
    <li>Laziness</li>
    <li>Scams & Fraud</li>
    <li>Endless calls, texts, messages & spam. </li>
    <li>Meetups with strangers</li>
    <li>Not proficient at selling</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
      So how do you cure one’s laziness? Or make up for a person’s lack of time? Or prevent scams or potentially dangerous meetups with strangers? It’s simple – hand over the task of selling to someone else. And that’s ListValet!

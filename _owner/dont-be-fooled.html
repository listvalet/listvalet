        Can you trust your government?  Can you trust the news?  Can you trust Amazon reviews?  Most surveys agree that the majority of Americans have an all time low confid  ence in institutions, notably government (federal and state), corporations and even Facebook. You know what people trust?   Amazon.  <a href="http://aicpoll.com/">Americans trust Amazon more than they trust local police.  Americans trust Amazon more than religion.</a>,
    <p>
        The biggest obstacle to adoption online retailers had to overcome was that consumers can’t “try on” or physically contact products before purchasing.  Amazon overcame this challenge by the implementation of reviews and a simple 5 star system. We  live in the aftermath of Amazon’s success. <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey-2014/">88% of consumers report trusting online reviews as much as a personal recommendation. </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        So here comes the painful truth, 1 in 3 of those reviews you’ve trusted are fake.
    </p>
    <p>
        That data comes from the fake review detection site, Fakespot.  Fakespot is a free website (and app)  that allows you to input the URL of any Amazon product and the output you recieve is an adjusted rating. Fakespot is an outside auditor that has distinguished itself as a significant new tool for consumers in every news story that has covered the underground market of fake reviews.  A similar website, ReviewMeta, puts the percentage of fake reviews at 11%.  But remember, that’s an average.  For example, reviews for popular tech accessory products (screen protectors, phone cases, charging cables, computer cables, earbud headphones, headphone adapters) has been placed at 50% fake by the same website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether 30% of the reviews are fake or 11%, both numbers stand in gross comparison to the 1% <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/629800775/some-amazon-reviews-are-too-good-to-be-believed-theyre-paid-for"> Amazon claims.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the CEO of FakeSpot, Saoud Khalifah, we’ve been programmed to trust these ratings.  <a href="https://thehustle.co/amazon-fake-reviews">The way Amazon presents reviews to you is a form of hypnosis,” says Khalifah, “They put a glowing 5 star review right in your face.”</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s true that products with the most 5 star ratings rise to the top of our product searches, often accompanied with the reassuring “Amazon Choice” badge.  ReviewMeta reports that in March 2019 alone, that of 2 million unverified reviews, <a href="https://thehustle.co/amazon-fake-reviews">99.6% of those were 5 stars.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        So, you’ll likely ask, should I only read reviews from customers with a “verified purchase” status?  It’s a good start.  Unfortunately, like any illegal activity, perpetrators have found ways to beat the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’ve previously found yourself wary of products that only have 5 star reviews, you have good instincts. Or common sense.  A universal truth of humanity is, you can’t please everyone.  Instead of looking for the highest percentage of 5 star ratings, look for a more realistic representation, a bell curve that looks like Nike’s swoosh.  What that means is, look for  a small percentage of 1 and 2 star ratings along with a high percent of 5 stars.  Although the likelihood of these products floating to the top of your search is unlikely, all of us at ListValet want to empower you to be a more conscious seller.

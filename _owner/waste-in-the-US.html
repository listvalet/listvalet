      You make 4.5 pounds of trash everyday
    </h1>

    <h3>
      <i>But you don't have to: an overview of waste produced and recycling in the U.S.</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      “Sustainability is a hot button topic,” my sister said to me on the phone.  She’s right, it is.  I see it within my own social circle.  Don’t we all have a friend that is impassioned about sustainability practices?  And on the other end of the spectrum, a friend or acquaintance who is cynical, perhaps even hostile about environmental concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the 1960s rise of awareness about human impact and adverse environmental consequences, the topic has become entangled in political debate.  For example, my own father holds the attitude that environmental concerns are a platform for democrat agendas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people you meet probably recycle when it’s readily available and convenient for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">EPA</a> produces a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-11/documents/2017_facts_and_figures_fact_sheet_final.pdf">“Advancing Sustainable Materials Management”</a> report every year.  The report dissects the quantity of trash produced, the material composition of trash, as well as generational trends and economic indicators that could affect trash production. The 2019 report is based on the most recent information available and reflects data from 1960 to 2017.

    </p>
    <p>
      “Solid waste generation peaked at 4.74 pounds per person per day in 2000. The rate of 4.51 pounds per person per day in 2017 is slightly lower than the 2016 rate, which was 4.53 pounds per person per day.” <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-11/documents/2017_facts_and_figures_fact_sheet_final.pdf">(source)</a>
    </p>
    <h2>
      You produce 4.5 pounds of garbage PER DAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Which seems insane, right? Take one day and record everything you put in the garbage can. When I did, I saw how quickly everything added up. My biggest offenders are food wrappers, single use food and drink containers, and product packaging .
    </p>
    <p>
      However when it comes to recycling and composting, the data isn’t devastating. As a nation we’re not completely failing to recycle.  One could argue we’re doing a decent job.

      There is, however, still a LOT of room for improvement.  Possibly the most frustrating aspect is the amount of solid waste that ends up in landfills that could have easily been recycled or composted.

      The graph above represents the material composition of our trash.  <a href="https://frontiergroup.org/page/fg/about-us">The Frontier Group</a> (I found this graph on their website) is a group formed in 1996 with the goal to “focus on bridging the gaps between academia, advocacy and citizen participation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And they make a very good point when they say, a lot of this trash can be composted or recycled.
      <ul>
        <li>Food waste and yard trimmings (making up 28.2% of garbage) can be composted</li>
        <li>Plastics, metals and glass (26.3%) can be recycled</li>
        <li>Paper and paperboard  (26.6%) can be recycled.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most unfortunate facet of our solid waste is the plastic packaging and containers.

      Food residue doesn’t make plastic containers ineligible for recycling, they just have to be washed out first.  This can be done at the recycling plant, or could be done in 30 seconds at home.  Cleaning plastic containers at recycling plants cost time and money. The dirtier the container, the progressive decrease of it’s worth. Meaning soiled plastic containers drain revenue (from the sale of these plastics) which helps pay for the whole recycling program. <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/clean-food-containers-recycling/">(source)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Paper and cardboard food and drink containers are a different story, as they easily absorb oil, making them completely ineligible for recycling. These are items like: candy wrappers, pizza boxes, beverage cups, and basically every container used in the fast food industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what are you supposed to do? Never order pizza again?

      Is the relationship between what can be recycled but doesn’t a lack of public education? I know personally, that if I don’t know it can be recycled, I throw it in the trash.  I think the first line of defense is education.  Recycling can be difficult because procedures vary locally.

      When it comes to living a more conscious sustainable lifestyle, there are some easy options as awareness and consumer demands for such products and options increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      ListValet is a great resource to see that your old furnishings or clothes go to new owners, without having to take the time to post and sell your items yourself.  It takes minimally more effort than simply throwing things away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a seller on ListValet, obviously you’re making money on your own time.  But did it cross your mind that your side hustle decreases waste production?
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus there are so many products that make sustainable choices the more appealing option. After the invention of vacuum sealed, steel insulated, temperature controlled drink containers, who would choose plastic cups or water bottles instead?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some ideas worth considering:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Reduce</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t buy or use plastic or paper plates or utensils</li>
        <li>Don’t buy paper towels
          <ul>
            <li>Invest in a reusable towel for cleaning; <a href="https://shopus.norwex.biz/en_US/customer/shop/Best_Sellers">Norwex</a> is a brand name, and here are some off brands from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=antibacterial+reusable&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Eat all of your food
          <ul>
            <li>And whatever food is necessary waste, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=does+food+going+down+the+garbage+disposal+get+composted&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS865US865&oq=does+food+going+down+the+garbage+disposal+get+composted&aqs=chrome..69i57.8601j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">use a garbage disposal rather than throw it in the trash</a>
              <ul>
                <li>Food waste doesn’t break down in landfills</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Don’t get a straw when eating out</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Reuse</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Invest in reusable <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reusable+food+containers&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS865US865&oq=reusable+food+containers&aqs=chrome.0.0l8.3150j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">containers</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reusable+utensils&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS865US865&oq=reusable+ut&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l7.7787j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">utensils</a> and products</li>
        <li>Bring your own reusable food containers and straws to restaurants</li>
        <li>Buy and use reusable <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reusable+coffee+cups&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS865US865&oq=reusable+coffee+cups&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i61l2j69i60.4232j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">coffee cups</a>
          <ul>
            <li>(and remember to use it! I started keeping mine in my car so I’d always have it whenever I stopped for coffee)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Buy and use reusable grocery bags
          <ul>
            <li>In my area, plastic grocery bags are not allowed in the recycling bin because, “Plastic bags cause significant issues with the equipment at recycling facilities, jamming up the machines and requiring the entire facility to halt operations so the plastic film can be removed.” <a href="https://slcgreenblog.com/2018/01/10/noplasticbags/">(source)</a></li>
            <li>Again, I started keeping grocery bags my car,  because I kept forgetting to grab them from home before going shopping</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Opt for going to bulk food markets, and bring your own reusable containers

            <li>In Salt Lake City, check out <a href="https://www.hellobulkmarkets.com/">Hello! Bulk</a></li>

      My friend, Schuyler, my sustainability zealot, makes a good point. “Sustainability isn’t a one time choice- it’s a million little choices. [Asking for] no straw, or taking your own silverware when you go out, choosing to not use a plastic bag. Small choices that can have a huge impact when stacked up!”

        (BOLD)Lystant(BOLD), a Utah based startup, takes on the challenge of reducing $390 billion of waste in the form of (UNDERLINE)unused items(UNDERLINE). According to Nielsen Customized Research, the average U.S. household has over 50 unused items worth $3,100. With 126 million households in the U.S., we can begin to grasp the enormity of this problem. To make matters worse, (ITALICS)most(ITALICS) items depreciate in value over time - resulting in literal waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        (BOLD)Why so many unused items?(BOLD) No matter how easy e-commerce platforms make selling online, there are still people who (1) don’t have time to sell (2) don’t know how to sell (3) or simply don’t want to sell the items themselves. This reluctance or inability to resell items has created this wasteful gap of stagnant items.
    </p>
    <p>
        (BOLD)So what is Lystant going to do about it?(BOLD) Lystant is bridging the gap between unused items and selling platforms by introducing personal salespeople called "Lystants" (listing assistants) as a middleman.
    </p>
    <p>
        (BOLD)What is Lystant?(BOLD) Lystant is a peer-2-peer consignment* platform, where users post items for local salespeople to pick-up and sell on their behalf. The user retains ownership of the item and is paid once the item is sold. Lystants utilize available selling channels (e-commerce platforms, social media, classified ads, etc.) to find a buyer and are paid a commission for each successful sale.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyone can sign up to become a Lystant (upon completion of a background check) and sell items for individuals in their community. Lystant's platform is poised to become a great source of secondary income for students, stay-home moms, or anyone looking to earn an extra buck.
    </p>
    <p>
        Could Lystant be the solution for reducing our enormous amount of waste? Helping people recycle their unused items back onto the market is surely a great start.

        *Consignment is the act of giving over to another person the care of an item, but retaining legal ownership until the item is sold. This act of consignment mostly occurs between an individual and a business, OR a business to business, but Lystant is a platform created for consignment between individuals in the local community.

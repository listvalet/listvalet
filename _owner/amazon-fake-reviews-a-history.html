        After learning that it’s estimated <a href="https://marketingland.com/study-finds-61-percent-of-electronics-reviews-on-amazon-are-fake-254055"> 1 in 3 of Amazon’s reviews are fake</a>, I like to think subsequent reaction to this statement is a question, “why?”.  If that is the case for you, thank you for asking, and please read on.

    <h3>
        Amazon customer reviews- a Brief History
    </h3>
    <p>
        Amazon’s implementation of customer reviews in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-10-15/amazon-turning-consumer-opinions-into-gold">1995 was considered preposterous</a> in it’s time. It makes relative sense why online retailers at that time would be hesitant to give consumers the ability to publish dissatisfaction with their products.  With the advantage of our perspective today, however, we can easily see how narrow minded that assumption was.  
    </p>
    <p>
        We know now, Amazon’s design built trust between the company and its consumers.  In fact, Americans trust Amazon more than they do their <a href="http://aicpoll.com/">local police departments</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Amazon put customer reviews into effect, they showed deep understanding of the consumer decision making process.  Perhaps Besoz had foresight about the research tool the internet would become. What we do know for certain is that Amazon has recently displaced Google as the first place consumers look for information concerning products. 
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.lsainsider.com/study-54-of-product-searches-began-on-amazon-in-the-second-quarter-of-2018/archives">54% of consumers start product searches on Amazon</a></h3>
    <p>
        Fraudulent reviews surely must have always been an annoyance.  But when exactly did the amount of fake reviews escalate from an annoyance to a plague? The evidence shows a clear correlation between Chinese sellers and scourge of fake reviews in recent years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relationship between Amazon and China is a whole story in it’s own right. I briefly discuss the relevant recent history, but for a more thorough explanation, I suggest <a href="https://www.ecomcrew.com/chinese-sellers-manipulating-amazon/">reading this</a>. However, keep in mind author bias. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        What’s China got to do with it?
    </h3>
    <p>
        In 2015, Amazon made a decision to empower the manufacturing giants in China to ship their goods directly to Amazon warehouses in the US, using the Amazon program <a href="https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.html">Fulfillment by Amazon</a>. An ex-Amazon manager Fahim Naim explains a big portion of private sellers were already based in China, this move simply eliminated “middle men”  to keep prices competitive.  
    </p>
    <p>
        After 2015, hundreds of thousands of <a href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/why-chinese-sellers-are-dominating-amazon/">new private Chinese sellers</a> emerged flooding the ecommerce site with a flood of products.  According to <a href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/why-chinese-sellers-are-dominating-amazon/">one source</a>, the amount of Chinese sellers doubled in 2015, representing a 20% growth in revenue for Amazon.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vast increase in sellers and sheer amount of products increased the difficulty of attracting the attention of consumers, fueling almost insurmountable competition. Especially if you’re (hypothetically) producing phone chargers indistinguishable from your competitors.

        So how does anyone succeed (let alone survive) in this environment? You must, cheesy pun intended, rise to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think about it, do you ever seriously search past page 2 on an Amazon product search?  
    </p>
    <p>
        "Being on the first page of Amazon is profoundly impactful for businesses," <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/629800775/some-amazon-reviews-are-too-good-to-be-believed-theyre-paid-for">Renée DiResta</a> explains. DiResta researches disinformation online as director of research at New Knowledge. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “To many Chinese Amazon sellers, the question of how to succeed on Amazon has a simple answer: reviews equal sales” explains Zach Franklin, an American now living in Shenzhen, China, who is a popular Amazon consultant to Chinese sellers.  
    </p>
    <p>
        So although we don’t know the algorithm that determines who rises to the top of product searches, it’s no secret that a large amount of 5 star ratings and positive reviews is an enormous factor. In a perfect world, this sort of marketplace meritocracy works.

    <h3>"The Game"</h3>
    <p>
        Saoud Khalifah, the man who runs Fakespot, an online fake review detection tool says, "We believe the review system is broken. People still don't realize how much the review system is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buyer-beware-a-scourge-of-fake-online-reviews-is-hitting-amazon-walmart-and-other-major-retailers/">gamed</a>."
    </p>
    <p>
        “These days it is very hard to sell anything on Amazon if you play fairly,” <a href="https://thehustle.co/amazon-fake-reviews">said Tommy Noonan</a>, who operates ReviewMeta, another website built to detect fake reviews. “If you want your product to be competitive, you have to somehow manufacture reviews.”
    </p>
    <p>
        To separate themselves from competitors, a lot of sellers started, for lack of a better word, purchasing reviews. Often called “incentivized reviews” sellers offered free, or discounted products, even payments for positive reviews. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Isn’t this illegal? Under federal law, exchanging money (or trading anything of value) for a dictated positive review is illegal.   
    </p>

  <div class="col">
    <h3>So what is Amazon doing about it?</h3>
    <p>
        In 2016, in a policy update, <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/update-on-customer-reviews">Amazon</a> said, “Our community guidelines have always prohibited compensation for reviews, with an exception – reviewers could post a review in exchange for a free or discounted product as long as they disclosed that fact.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok, so the incentivized reviews were given the green light as long as there was disclosure, provided that the reviewee wasn’t told what to say. To differentiate, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking">FTC calls these “endorsements</a>”.  In theory, I understand the difference. In practice? I just don’t think the fact you’re being “endorsed” (incentivized, whatever) isn’t going to influence your “honest” review. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In that same policy update, Amazon unveiled, “Today, we updated the community guidelines to prohibit incentivized reviews unless they are facilitated through the Amazon Vine program.”
    </p>
    <p>
        So, no incentivized reviews, unless they’re OUR incentivized reviews. More accurately, Amazon, not the seller or advertiser, facilitates these incentivized reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-merchants-secretly-use-facebook-to-flood-amazon-with-fake-reviews/2018/04/23/5dad1e30-4392-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html">experts</a> say this move just pushed the thriving economy of paid-for positive reviews underground. They’re becoming increasingly savvy in avoiding detection. The truth is, there is not going to be an immediate solution. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next segment of this series, I’ll explain how these illegal operations are conducted.

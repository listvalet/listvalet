      How fake reviews and cheap products burn us all and who is the biggest victim
    </h2>
    <p>
      Incentivized reviews, a marketing tool where vendors solicit “honest” reviews from customers in exchange for free or discounted products was banned from Amazon in <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/update-on-customer-reviews"> 2016</a>. Although many factors went into this decision, the most prominent was likely the increasing consumer distrust with these kinds of reviews, and the plague of fake reviews that was pervading Amazon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distrust and suspicion over the authenticity of incentivized reviews is, in my opinion,  a universally natural reaction.  Data supports this suspicion, incentivized reviews get 13% more 5-star ratings than non-incentivized.

    </p>
    <p>
      Amazon’s 2016 ban was also very likely a reactive response to the spawn of both incentivized and totally fake reviews in 2015, the year where Chinese merchant sales increased tenfold on Amazon sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two events are related.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quote to the Wall Street Journal, Chris McCabe, former investigator for Amazon who now works as a consultant helping Amazon sellers combat counterfeit competition, said cheaper imitation counterfeit products and inauthentic reviews have, “all gone through the roof with the rise of Chinese sellers.”

    <h3>
      <u>Why Amazon loves Chinese companies</u>
    </h3>
    <p>
      It’s no secret that Amazon is actively “courting” Chinese business. Eric Broussard, Amazon’s vice president of international seller services, <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2015/12/09/amazon-helps-chinese-merchants-double-sales-amazon-sites/">said</a> “China is one of the important markets for our Global Store business and we are very glad to see the fast growth for Chinese merchants in global markets. Amazon will keep increasing our investments in China to help more Chinese companies expand all over the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazon effectively hacked the supply chain to get mostly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/672782/net-sales-of-amazon-leading-markets/">American</a> consumers as close to Chinese factories as possible, resulting in the cheapest possible prices on Amazon.  It’s a popular move, “cutting out the middleman”, because each step in the supply chain means a price <a href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/why-chinese-sellers-are-dominating-amazon/">markup of 50%-100%.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      To Amazon’s credit, they are trying to get the sharpest possible prices to customers.  It’s also been incredibly beneficial for Amazon’s bottom line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Introducing third party sellers has been integral to Amazon’s growth. “Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed in the company's annual letter to shareholders in April 2019 that third-party sellers make up a bigger share of sales on Amazon's marketplace than Amazon itself, racking up $160 billion to Amazon's first-party retail business' $117 billion in 2018.” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-third-party-sellers-record-high-sales-2019-5">(source)</a>
      <img src="/img/ownerStock/graph3.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the 10,000 most-reviewed accounts on Amazon's U.S. site whose locations could be determined in October of this year, about 38% were in China, <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/47-of-top-amazon-sellers-based-in-us-38-based-in-china">Marketplace Pulse</a> calculates, compared with 25% three years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, a probably unforeseen ramification was, “at least 50% of Chinese sellers are using some form of review strategy against Amazon’s terms of service,” said  <a href="http://mlsourcingpro.ml/index.php/2019/09/06/how-chinese-sellers-are-manipulating-amazon-stolen-amazon-data-zombie-accounts-fake-reviews/">Zach Franklin</a> of AMZKungfu, a popular American consultant among Chinese sellers.

    <h3>
      <ul>Are fake reviews really that big of a deal?</ul>
    </h3>
    <p class="">
      It’s critical to understand that fake reviews don’t only undermine the entire review system by falsely inflating ratings, often pushing lower quality products to the first pages of product searches and burying honest merchants in obscured penultimate pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Misleading consumers with false reviews can have disastrous consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-heavy-recruitment-of-chinese-sellers-puts-consumers-at-risk-11573489075">The Wall Street Journal</a> wrote, “The Journal earlier this year uncovered 10,870 items for sale between May and August that have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled, lacked federally-required warnings, or are banned by federal regulators. Of 1,934 sellers whose addresses could be determined, 54% were based in China.”
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The WSJ article featured a man from Georgia who bought a faulty hoverboard on Amazon that caught fire and burned down his entire house.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/629800775/some-amazon-reviews-are-too-good-to-be-believed-theyre-paid-for">NPR</a> tells the story of a teenager who bought a combination rifle trigger lock from Amazon (influenced by multiple 5 star reviews), and reported, “The combination doesn't even matter; the lock just opens. It's cheap plastic, it will pull apart as soon as you give it any force." </li>
      <li>Zack Crockett, while writing a story for The Hustle, was commissioned to buy an iPhone charger by a Chinese vendor in exchange for a 5 star review.  The charger was 3rd on the first page results for “iPhone charger”, had nearly 4,000 5-star reviews and “had been knighted with an ‘Amazon’s Choice’ label”. Of the 3 charging cables he received, one’s cord broke off after he plugged it into his phone, and the second one sent his phone into a voltage irregularity, which can permanently damage electronics. He reported the third one seemed to work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Amazon is not liable for the safety of the products sold on their site, which makes sense, they’re just the platform, not the actual manufacturers.  It’s a verdict that has been upheld by legal precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the man whose house was burnt down by the hoverboard sued Amazon for negligence for not removing the dangerous products from it’s website. Amazon did not pay for any damages because it did not <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-heavy-recruitment-of-chinese-sellers-puts-consumers-at-risk-11573489075">“design, manufacture, or sell the hoverboard.”</a> The man then tried to sue the seller, Panda Town, which appeared to be a Chinese company, however he couldn’t locate the seller to file a suit, and Amazon declined to provide its location.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Washington state's attorney general's office said Amazon agreed to pay $700,000 as part of a legally binding agreement after an investigation revealed dozens of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-heavy-recruitment-of-chinese-sellers-puts-consumers-at-risk-11573489075">products marketed toward children had excessive lead and cadmium.</a> The products were made in China, the office said, some sold by China-based third parties. Amazon didn't admit wrongdoing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this against Amazon’s mission statement, “Our vision is to be the earth’s most customer-centric company…”

    <h3>
      <ul>Amazon takes action, but is it enough?</ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Amazon’s brand faces potential devastating damage as more press emerges about fraudulent reviews that boost the sales of cheap, dangerous products.  But it is the honest sellers and consumers who are the immediate casualties.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Amazon’s credit, there has been a significant decrease of fake reviews since the 2016 ban. The company has even retroactively deleted fake reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://reviewmeta.com/">ReviewMeta</a>, a free web tool that “analyzes Amazon product reviews and filters out reviews that our algorithm detects may be unnatural”, creator and CTO, Tommy Noonan, reported, “for every incentivized review we found on Amazon, there were 2.6 in our database that weren’t there anymore,” in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/23/amazon-made-good-on-its-promise-to-delete-incentivized-reviews/?guccounter=1">November 2016</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Noonan also <a href="https://thehustle.co/amazon-fake-reviews">stated</a>, “Their way of handling [fake reviews] is reactive, not proactive. Amazon is a $900B company with thousands of brilliant engineers, I majored in construction management. It seems like they should be able to figure this one out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazon has a documented history of prosecuting found fake reviews. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/18/amazon-sues-1000-fake-reviewers">2015</a>, Amazon sued more than 1,000 unidentified individuals found writing fake reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in October of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/24/how-amazon-counterfeits-put-this-mans-business-on-brink-of-collapse.html">2016</a>, CNBC published a feature story about Mark Lopreiato, creator of patented moving product called Forearm Forklift, whose business was being irrevocably “ravaged over the past half-decade by counterfeiters, mostly selling on Amazon. Scores of merchants have copied the patented product, using its name, images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on price.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In November of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-sues-sellers-for-offering-fake-goods-on-its-site-1479243852">2016</a>, in a first of its kind lawsuit, Amazon prosecuted third party sellers peddling counterfeits in two cases. One case against athletic equipment design copying TRX, and the second against sellers of fake Forearm Forklift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazon’s legal filings stated, “When customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers, and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon’s brand and causing irreparable reputational harm.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Lopreiato called the lawsuit a publicity stunt. In the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/15/amazon-takes-counterfeit-sellers-to-court-for-first-time.html">November CNBC article</a>, Lopreiato said, “Where do I benefit in this at all?” Amazon is the sole plaintiff in the suit, “even if the businesses listed as defendants lose the suit, there are more than 100 infringers still on Amazon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      C.J. Rosenbaum, a lawyer who represents Amazon sellers and author of “Amazon Law Library,” a book that compiled all Amazon’s legal issues, said the breakneck turnover in vendor management combined with the inconsistency with responding to issues is a constant source of frustration for sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Amazon’s responses are very erratic,” Rosenbaum said. (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/24/how-amazon-counterfeits-put-this-mans-business-on-brink-of-collapse.html">source</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of publically boasting their efforts by legal action, Lopreiato says Amazon should work with the original brands to systematically take down bogus sellers.  Before the suit, Lopreito says he filed more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to the criminal third party sellers and just as many take down notices to Amazon.

      Dave Bryant, an entrepreneur who sold his multi-million dollar ecommerce business in 2016 and create another 7-figure business within 18 months, <a href="http://mlsourcingpro.ml/index.php/2019/09/06/how-chinese-sellers-are-manipulating-amazon-stolen-amazon-data-zombie-accounts-fake-reviews/">wrote</a>, “in my personal experience as a seller, Amazon seemingly allows nearly any selling strategy to slide until a wave of negative press arrives that threatens its revenues.” <br>
      (The author states his article was originally published by <a href="https://www.ecomcrew.com/chinese-sellers-manipulating-amazon/">ecomcrew.com</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem">Buzzfeed News</a> reported. “sellers trying to play by the rules are struggling to stay afloat amid a sea of fraudulent reviews, and buyers are unwittingly purchasing inferior or downright faulty products. And Amazon is all but powerless to stop it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, Buzzfeed? “Powerless”? <br>
      To the journalistic geniuses at Buzzfeed, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryant said, “There are several (reasonable) actionable things that, in my opinion, Amazon could do to help eradicate many of the problems addressed in this article:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Institute <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=project+zero&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS865US865&oq=project+zero&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.2357j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Project Zero</a> for all Brand Registered sellers</li>
      <li>Allow more frequent brand-gating for Brand Registered sellers who experience high rates of counterfeit sellers</li>
      <li>Give sellers more insight into search history and product performance to eliminate the black market for stolen reports</li>
      <li>Do not allow listing contributions from anyone but the Brand Registered owners of products</li>
      <li>Remove the expensive Trademark requirement for Brand Registry to allow smaller brands to more affordably protect their brand”</li>

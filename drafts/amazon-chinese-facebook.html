      Brief Review
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Because of various strategic global expansion implementations within Amazon, the number of Chinese sellers on Amazon more than <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2015/12/09/amazon-helps-chinese-merchants-double-sales-amazon-sites/">doubled</a> in 2015</li>
      <li>In <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/update-on-customer-reviews">2016</a> Amazon updated community guidelines to ban incentivized reviews</li>
      <li>Today, estimations of fake and incentivized Amazon reviews vary from 11% up to 64% in certain product categories</li>
      <li>These events are linked</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Competition created the game
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sudden, enormous increase of Chinese sellers on Amazon caused unprecedented competition for both new Chinese and existing sellers. In the growing pain, suspicious online behavior rose to unfathomable levels, and has been a significant problem ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst part? Most people don’t even know about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the story of Antigoin, an electronics company based in Shenzen, China. In November of 2018, their $30 headphones had an inconsequential amount of reviews.  By February the same headphones had 927 reviews and appeared at the top of unsponsored search results. Many of the reviews had simple repeated phrases like, “comfortable to wear.”  Amazon removed the company Antigoin from their site after the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-merchants-secretly-use-facebook-to-flood-amazon-with-fake-reviews/2018/04/23/5dad1e30-4392-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html">Washington Post</a> started making inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      To many Chinese Amazon sellers, the equation for lucrative business is simple: a product that’s cheap to make and has broad appeal + large numbers of 5-star reviews = high profit margins.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/26/amazon-cracks-down-on-fake-reviews-with-another-lawsuit/">2015</a> Amazon took legal action against website operators that openly advertised procuring positive reviews: Amazonverifiedreviews.com, Paidbookreviews.org, Amazonreviewstar.com, Buyamazonreviews.info, Reviewconnections.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the suit, an Amazon lawyer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-has-begun-suing-sites-that-provide-fake-product-reviews-2015-4">wrote</a>, “Despite substantial efforts to stamp out the practice, an unhealthy ecosystem is developing outside of Amazon to supply inauthentic reviews.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The general consensus is that Amazon’s 2016 ban simply forced “the game” of producing positive reviews into the shadows. When I typed in “amazonverifiedreviews.com” I was redirected to a webpage with a single image:
        <img src="/img/ownerStock/amazon_verified.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        While there is a dark underbelly of obscure online resources where merchants can continue to obtain illicit reviews, the favored hunting ground hides in plain sight. The still thriving economy of fraudulent 5 stars conducts business as usual through Amazon’s behemoth bedfellow, Facebook.

      <ul>The game’s new arena: Facebook</ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Zachary Crockett, in a genuinely impressive piece of journalism written for <a href="https://thehustle.co/amazon-fake-reviews">The Hustle</a>, infiltrated various private Facebook groups to investigate the illegal side of e-commerce. These groups generate discussions in magnitude, and add members in exponential growth. Up to ten thousand members in one month. (<a href="https://www.vaughnlaw.com/blog/2018/8/31/npr-covers-the-fake-review-problem">source</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/629800775/some-amazon-reviews-are-too-good-to-be-believed-theyre-paid-for">NPR</a> presented a story about an American teenager who generated income by writing incentivized reviews.  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-merchants-secretly-use-facebook-to-flood-amazon-with-fake-reviews/2018/04/23/5dad1e30-4392-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html">The Washington Post</a> interviewed Renee DiResta, a “policy leader for the nonprofit Data for Democracy, a group of technology researchers dedicated to promoting integrity online”, who did a similar investigative infiltration into Facebook groups of this nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like The Hustle’s account best because (as far as I can tell) they are not affiliated with Amazon, whereas NPR disclosed Amazon is one of their (most likely substantial) financial sponsors, and TWP is owned by Jeff Bezos.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <a href="https://thehustle.co/amazon-fake-reviews">The Hustle</a>, Crockett explains the process is relatively simple:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A seller will post onto a discussion board “FREE (product). refund + $5 commission for 5 STAR. PM for details.”</li>
      <li>Interested member of the group will respond in a private message</li>
      <li>The seller directs the buyer to the product on Amazon using keywords.</li>
      <li>The buyer purchases the product, follows instructions about when and how to post a 5 star review</li>
      <li>The seller sends the buyer a refund via PayPal, plus a commission (usually in the form of a $5-10 gift card).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The majority of these seller Facebook profiles prove to be obvious fakes with a little research, but place most users in industrial Chinese cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one instance Crockett asked the seller (through private messages) if the proposed transaction was legal, to which the seller immediately responded  “yes.”  After additional inquiry and slight pressure from Crockett, the seller disclosed “well actually...I can’t consider this as legal. But hear me out. We are doing this [to] help our item make sales. We are competing with thousands of screen protectors out there.”

      <ul>It’s The Hunger Games out there and Amazon is the Capitol</ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Their plea justifying illegal activity uncovers the rationale of individuals and companies operating inside this intense pressure cooker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chinese sellers are definitely at a disadvantage with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/672782/net-sales-of-amazon-leading-markets/">Amazon’s predominantly American</a> consumer base.  There is an increased obstacle to adopting their products over familiar, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-merchants-secretly-use-facebook-to-flood-amazon-with-fake-reviews/2018/04/23/5dad1e30-4392-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html">entrenched</a>” western brands for market share, as well as domestic competition manufacturing identical products.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They’re almost all for these off-brand, cheap electronic products: Phone chargers, headphones, cables,” says Tommy Noonan, a gym rat turned into a customer review analyst after purchasing some unsavory supplements from Amazon. Noonan now runs <a href="https://reviewmeta.com/">ReviewMeta</a>.  “Generic things that are super cheap to manufacture, have good margins, and get a ton of searches.” <a href="https://thehustle.co/amazon-fake-reviews">(source)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, like most crimes, these operations are born out of desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These days it is very hard to sell anything on Amazon if you play fairly” Noonan explains, “If you want your product to be competitive, you have to somehow manufacture reviews.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-merchants-secretly-use-facebook-to-flood-amazon-with-fake-reviews/2018/04/23/5dad1e30-4392-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html">(source)</a>

      <ul>Increasingly deceitful tactics to avoid detection</ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      According to one <a href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/why-chinese-sellers-are-dominating-amazon/">account</a> by Steve Chou, an entrepreneur, the Chinese have many companies that buy and sell both positive and negative ambush reviews, as well as hundreds of backup seller accounts in case one gets banned by Amazon.  Chou even states, “If you’ve sold on Amazon for any length of time, you’ve probably been the target of a malicious negative review attack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Amazon attempts to crack down on suspicious reviews, the criminal activity adapts. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-merchants-secretly-use-facebook-to-flood-amazon-with-fake-reviews/2018/04/23/5dad1e30-4392-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html">DiResta</a>, the Chinese sellers target Amazon user accounts with an established history of reviews. By employing mercenary reviewers to order their products, the reviews get the coveted “verified purchase” badge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travis, the teenage paid reviewer, explained to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/629800775/some-amazon-reviews-are-too-good-to-be-believed-theyre-paid-for">NPR</a> that purchasing details will be very specific: Ordering using a specified Amazon link, don't clip any coupons or promo codes, wait 4 to 5 days after receiving the item before leaving a review, to look more authentic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Make sure your reviews don’t sound overly fake and make sure you review other items too, not just from Chinese sellers,” Araceli Morales advised Crockett. “Never write ‘love.’” Morales was responsible for 112 five star reviews for Amazon sellers through Facebook listings during the time of The Hustle story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my professors told my class that his elderly parents living in the American southeast get random Amazon items sent to their house sporadically.  He’s convinced his parents have been targeted and the home address is being used by an Amazon review producer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Amazon, detecting false reviews has become a real whack-a-mole problem.

      <ul>Understanding Cultural Disparities</ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Chinese culture values long term orientation. Meaning success in life is motivated and defined by long term goals, like sending your children, or grand children to college.  Arguably, this cultural perspective is a key reason why Chinese Americans have been so prosperous as a minority emigrant group in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I think this long-term orientation perspective could help explain why breaking the rules, or “gaming” the system, is seen as a justifiable step to surviving the introduction of a product within the context of a long term business plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese are also an uncertainty avoidance culture.  In this regard, the West is completely the opposite; we value risk taking. Consequently, choices Americans would applaud as bold, the Chinese would disdain as precarious. Introducing products onto Amazon represents taking a risk. I suggest that manipulating the environment to favor their risks would lessen the resulting cognitive dissonance that inevitably would piggyback these decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s also no secret that the Chinese are a hard working people. <a href="https://affiliateworldconferences.com/blog/speakers/zack-franklin/">Zach Franklin</a>, CEO of AMZKungfu, wrote, “Most [Chinese] sellers I know just want to build a real, defensible brand...They want to do things in the right way and they’re working from 9 am – 9 pm, 6 days a week to do it.”
    </p>

    <h3>
      So who is the biggest culprit and who is the biggest victim?
    </h3>
    <p>
      In fewer words, I think the deception is a culturally influenced coping method. But before blame is assigned wholly to the Chinese, remember it’s numerous Americans who are writing the fabricated reviews, willing accomplices.  And American sellers on Amazon are doing the exact same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/01/amazon-sues-sellers-for-buying-fake-reviews/">2016</a>, Amazon filed lawsuits against 3 defendants who created fake accounts to leave positive reviews on their own products.  The fake reviews allegedly accounted for 30-45% of their total reviews.  Two of the defendants are Americans, the other is a Chinese company called CCBetter Direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all other features are comparably equal, consumers buy the cheapest product. What consumers may not know is the high price of buying cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chinese supplied products are cheaper than domestic products because Chinese businesses don’t bear the financial weight of having to pay sales tax, workers compensation, commercial insurance, patent payments, or insure product quality while at the same time being much less susceptible to liability lawsuits. The Chinese are also infamous for underselling authentic brands with cheaper counterfeits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, Chinese sellers might be victims by sheer quantity, struggling to survive intense competition, but they are leaving victims in their wake.  Which leads to an interesting follow up question; between Amazon itself, its third party sellers, and its customers, who is the biggest victim, and who is truly responsible?
